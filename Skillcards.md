# What skill cards are there?
There are 4 different classes of skill cards: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Rainbow. The higher the class, the more skill gauge points it costs to activate a card.

# How does one use a skill card?
To use a skill card, you will have to raise your skill gauge by either attacking an opponent or by being attacked by an opponent.

Once you have gained enough skill gauge points you will be able to activate a skill card by right-clicking your mouse.
